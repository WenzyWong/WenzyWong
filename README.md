Pronouns: they/them.

My current research keywords: Bioinformatics; Cancer Research; Microbiome.

There’s something about interdisciplinary research that always pulls me in. Synthesising and connecting ideas is truly a fascinating act of creative intelligence. I’ve always had a deep love for nature, and I really enjoy hiking. Maybe one day I’ll even find myself working on something related to ecology — who knows.

Lately, I’ve been hoping to improve my ability to understand and refine algorithms, as I don’t want to just be a machine that runs omics analyses.

I have all sorts of scattered thoughts about research itself. Check my blog for more details: [Wenzy Wong - Blog](https://wenzywong.blog/) 💭.

I'm seeking exchange opportunities during my doctoral studies, and also starting to think about postdoc positions down the line.
