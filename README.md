## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**WenzyWong/WenzyWong** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

This is Wenzy, a Ph.D. student at Fundan University. 

Pronouns: they/them.

My current research keywords: Bioinformatics; Cancer Research; Microbiome.

Thereâ€™s something about interdisciplinary research that always pulls me in. Synthesising and connecting ideas is truly a fascinating act of creative intelligence. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been hoping to improve my ability to understand and refine algorithms, as I donâ€™t want to just be a machine that runs omics analyses.

You can find all sorts of my scattered thoughts about research. Check my blog for more details: [Wenzy Wong - Blog](https://wenzywong.blog/) ðŸ’­. Since Iâ€™m such a nature lover (Iâ€™m keen on hiking), I might well move into ecology research later on â€” who knows?

I'm seeking exchange opportunities during my doctoral studies, and also starting to think about postdoc positions down the line.
